          More than half of all crypto gamblers now play from mobile ‚Äî this guide helps you find the best wallet, casino, and setup to play on the go.<br/>
          Crypto casinos are going mobile. Whether you're playing from the couch, the train, or your lunch break, mobile gambling lets you enjoy fast and private play wherever you are.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-pink-400">üì≤ 1. Choose a Mobile-Friendly Crypto Casino</h2>
        <p>
          Not every crypto casino is built with mobile in mind. Some are optimized beautifully for your phone, while others still struggle with layout and buttons. Always test if the platform is responsive or offers a dedicated app.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>Responsive layout that adapts to your screen</li>
          <li>Bonuses that work on mobile</li>
          <li>Wallet integration that doesn‚Äôt require desktop setup</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-pink-400">üëõ 2. Use a Mobile Wallet</h2>
        <p>
          A reliable mobile wallet is the key to fast and secure transactions. Look for options that offer biometric security and direct Web3 integration.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>Trust Wallet: Easy and multi-chain</li>
          <li>MetaMask Mobile: Great for ETH casinos</li>
          <li>Hardware or desktop wallets are less practical on mobile</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-pink-400">‚öôÔ∏è 3. Quick Setup & Play</h2>
        <p>
          Once your wallet is connected, you're usually just a few taps away from playing. Mobile casinos aim to make things seamless, so you can go from deposit to spin in under a minute.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>Connect wallet, claim bonus, and play. No extra steps.</li>
          <li>Games optimized for swipe and tap</li>
          <li>Quick cashouts via wallet integration</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-pink-400">üö´ Watch Out For</h2>
        <p>
          While mobile play is convenient, not all casinos deliver a good experience. Avoid platforms with poor mobile interfaces or payment issues.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>Sites that aren‚Äôt mobile responsive</li>
          <li>Bonus offers not available on mobile</li>
          <li>Wallet connections that break in mobile view</li>
