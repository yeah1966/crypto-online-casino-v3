## ðŸ§  Provably Fair Games Explained

In crypto gambling, "provably fair" means you can verify that outcomes are not manipulated. This transparency is made possible by cryptographic algorithms that let you check every result yourself.

### How Does It Work?
- **Server seed:** Secret hash generated by the casino
- **Client seed:** Your browser generates this, or you can set it
- **Result:** Both seeds + a nonce are hashed to create the outcome
- **Verification:** Anyone can check if the hash and result match

> "It's like rolling dice in public, recording the math, and letting anyone double-check it later."

### Why Does It Matter?
- Cheating is virtually impossible
- Players can trust the results
- Many top crypto casinos offer provably fair games
