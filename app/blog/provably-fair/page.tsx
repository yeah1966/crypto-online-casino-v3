          <h2><span className="text-2xl md:text-3xl align-middle mr-2">🧠</span>The Concept Behind Provably Fair</h2>
          <p>
            In a traditional online casino, the fairness of a game depends entirely on the casino operator’s honesty. You’re told that outcomes are “random,” but unless a regulator is actively auditing them, you just have to trust the software.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Provably fair gaming flips that model.</strong></p>
          <p className="mb-10">
            In provably fair systems, the outcome of a game is mathematically verifiable. It uses blockchain-inspired cryptography so that you, the player, can check if the outcome was truly random and untampered with.
          </p>

          <h2><span className="text-2xl md:text-3xl align-middle mr-2">🛠</span>How It Works (Without the Tech Overload)</h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-100">
            <li>
              <strong>Server Seed (Casino) + Client Seed (You):</strong> Before a game round, the casino generates a hashed “server seed”. You can’t see the actual value yet — just the encrypted version (like a fingerprint). You, the player, can also input your own “client seed” if you want.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Random Result Generation:</strong> When the game round is played, the casino combines the server seed and your client seed with a random “nonce” (a number that increases every round) to generate the outcome. This ensures unpredictability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Verification:</strong> After the round, the casino reveals the original server seed. You can now hash it yourself and verify it matches the version you saw at the start — proving that the outcome wasn’t manipulated.
            </li>
          </ol>

          width={800}
          height={450}

        <section className={proseClass}>
          <h2><span className="text-2xl md:text-3xl align-middle mr-2">🧩</span>Why Does This Matter?</h2>
          <p>
            Because it removes the need to blindly trust the casino.<br />
            With provably fair systems, even if the platform is unlicensed or new, players can independently verify every result. That’s a big deal in a world where shady operators can easily rig games behind the scenes.
          </p>
          <p><strong>It’s especially important for:</strong></p>
          <ul className="mb-10">
            <li>High-stakes crypto gamblers</li>
            <li>Players who value privacy over KYC</li>
            <li>Tech-savvy users who want transparency</li>
          </ul>

          <h2><span className="text-2xl md:text-3xl align-middle mr-2">🔍</span>Does Every Crypto Casino Offer This?</h2>
          <p>
            No — and that’s the catch.<br />
            Not all crypto casinos are provably fair, and many hybrid casinos (fiat + crypto) still rely on traditional RNGs. It’s important to check the game provider (e.g. Spribe, BC Originals, Stake Originals, etc.) or look for a provably fair badge.<br />
            <span className="inline-block bg-yellow-900 text-yellow-300 px-3 py-1 rounded-lg font-semibold ml-1">Tip:</span> Casinos like Stake, BC.Game, and Cloudbet are known for offering provably fair games.
          </p>
          <div className="mb-10" />
          <h2><span className="text-2xl md:text-3xl align-middle mr-2">✅</span>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p className="mb-10">
            If you’re serious about fairness, provably fair technology is your friend. It brings the blockchain spirit of transparency into online gambling — giving power back to the player.<br />
            Before you bet your next satoshi, make sure your game is provably fair. Your wallet will thank you later.
